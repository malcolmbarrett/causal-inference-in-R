There are no unmeasured confounders\n2.  Every subject has a nonzero probability of receiving either exposure\n\n## Logistic Regression\n\nThere are many ways to estimate the propensity score; typically, people use logistic regression for binary exposures.\nThe logistic regression model predicts the exposure using known confounders.\nEach individual's predicted value is the propensity score.\nThe `glm()` function will fit a logistic regression model in R.\nBelow is pseudo-code.\nThe first argument is the model, with the exposure on the left side and the confounders on the right.\nThe `data` argument takes the data frame, and the `family = binomial()` argument denotes the model should be fit using logistic regression (as opposed to a different generalized linear model).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglm(\n  exposure ~ confounder_1 + confounder_2,\n  data = df,\n  family = binomial()\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can extract the propensity scores by pulling out the predictions on the probability scale.\nUsing the `augment()` function from the [{`broom`}](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package, we can extract these propensity scores and add them to our original data frame.\nThe argument `type.predict` is set to `\"response\"` to indicate that we want to extract the predicted values on the *probability* scale.\nBy default, these will be on the linear logit scale.\nThe `data` argument contains the original data frame.\nThis code will output a new data frame consisting of all components in `df` with six additional columns corresponding to the logistic regression model that was fit.\nThe `.fitted` column is the propensity score.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglm(\n  exposure ~ confounder_1 + confounder_2,\n  data = df,\n  family = binomial()\n) |>\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\", data = df)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's look at an example.\n\n### Extra Magic Hours at Magic Kingdom {#sec-prop-dag}\n\nRecall our causal question of interest from @sec-data: **Is there a relationship between whether there were \"Extra Magic Hours\" in the morning at Magic Kingdom and the average wait time for an attraction called the \"Seven Dwarfs Mine Train\" the same day between 9am and 10am in 2018?** Below is a proposed DAG for this question.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proposed DAG for the relationship between Extra Magic Hours in the morning at a particular park and the average wait time between 9 am and 10 am. Here we are saying that we believe 1) Extra Magic Hours impacts average wait time and 2) both Extra Magic Hours and average wait time are determined by the time the park closes, historic high temperatures, and ticket season.](chapter-07_files/figure-html/fig-dag-magic-hours-wait-1.png){#fig-dag-magic-hours-wait width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn @fig-dag-magic-hours-wait, we propose three confounders: the historic high temperature on the day, the time the park closed, and the ticket season: value, regular, or peak.\nWe can build a propensity score model using the `seven_dwarfs_train_2018` data set from the `{touringplans}` package.\nEach row of this dataset contains information about the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train during a particular hour on a given day.\nFirst, we need to subset the data to only include average wait times between 9 and 10 am.\nThen we will use the `glm()` function to fit the propensity score model, predicting `park_extra_magic_morning` using the four confounders specified above.\nWe'll add the propensity scores to the data frame (in a column called `.fitted` as set by the `augment()` function in the `{broom}` package).\n\n\n:::

seven_dwarfs_9)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's take a look at these propensity scores.\n@tbl-df-ps shows the propensity scores (in the `.fitted` column) for the first six days in the dataset, as well as the values of each day's exposure, outcome, and confounders.\nThe propensity score here is the probability that a given date will have Extra Magic Hours in the morning given the observed confounders, in this case, the historical high temperatures on a given date, the time the park closed, and Ticket Season.\nFor example, on January 1, 2018, there was a 30.2% chance that there would be Extra Magic Hours at the Magic Kingdom given the Ticket Season (peak in this case), time of park closure (11 pm), and the historic high temperature on this date (58.6 degrees).\nOn this particular day, there were *not* Extra Magic Hours in the morning (as indicated by the 0 in the first row of the `park_extra_magic_morning` column).\n\n\n::: {#tbl-df-ps .cell tbl-cap='The first six observations in the

package's `geom_mirror_histogram()` to create one.\nThe code below creates two histograms of the propensity scores, one on the \"top\" for the exposed group (the dates with Extra Magic Hours in the morning) and one on the \"bottom\" for the unexposed group.\nWe'll also tweak the y-axis labels to use absolute values (rather than negative values for the bottom histogram) via

@fig-mirrored-ps.\n\n<!-- TODO: This section needs to be clarified. -->\n\n1.  Look for lack of overlap as a potential positivity problem.\n    But too much overlap may indicate a poor model \n    <!-- (TODO: not necessarily. depends on the relative covariate distributions in the two groups). -->\n\n2.  Avg treatment effect among treated is easier to estimate with precision (because of higher counts) than in the control group.\n\n3.  A single outlier in either group concerning range could be a problem and warrant data inspection\n<!-- (TODO: do this here?) *look at the model coefs here*. -->\n\n<!-- *TODO* This may be a \"nice\" example -- should we also show a bad model (maybe only with ticket season or possibly overspecifying it) -->\n\n## Choosing what variables to include {#sec-choosing-vars}\n\nThe best way to decide what variables to include in your propensity score model is to look at your DAG and have at least a minimal adjustment set of confounders.\nOf course, sometimes, essential variables are missing or measured with error.\nIn addition, there is often more than one theoretical adjustment set that debiases your estimate; it may be that one of the minimal adjustment sets is measured well in your data set and another is not.\nIf you have confounders on your DAG that you do not have access to, sensitivity analyses can help quantify the potential impact.\nSee Chapter 11 for an in-depth discussion of sensitivity analyses.\n\nAccurately specifying a DAG improves our ability to add the correct variables to our models.\nHowever, confounders are not the only necessary type of variable to consider.\nFor example, variables that are predictors of the *outcome* *but not the exposure* can improve the precision of propensity score models.\nConversely, including variables that are predictors of the *exposure but not the outcome* (instrumental variables) can bias the model.\nLuckily, this bias seems relatively negligible in practice, especially compared to the risk of confounding bias [@Myers2011].\n\n::: callout-note\nSome estimates, such as the odds and hazard ratios, suffer from an additional problem called *non-collapsibility*.\nFor these estimates, adding noise variables (variables unrelated to the exposure or outcome) doesn't reduce precision: they can bias the estimate as well---more the reason to avoid data-driven approaches to selecting variables for causal models.\n:::\n\nAnother variable to be wary of is a *collider*, a descendant of both the exposure and outcome.\nIf you specify your DAG correctly, you can avoid colliders by only using adjustment sets that completely close backdoor paths from the exposure to the outcome.\nHowever, some circumstances make this difficult: some colliders are inherently stratified by the study's design or the nature of follow-up.\nFor example, loss-to-follow-up is a common source of collider-stratification bias; in Chapter XX, we'll discuss this further.\n\nA variable can also be both a confounder and a collider, as in the case of so-called butterfly bias:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggdag(butterfly_bias()) +\n  theme_dag()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A causal diagram that displays a variable `m`, which is both a collider and a confounder for `x` and `y`. In situations where you don't have all measured variables in a DAG, you may have to make a tough choice about which type of bias is the least bad.\n](chapter-07_files/figure-html/fig-butterfly-dag-1.png){#fig-butterfly-dag width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nConsider @fig-butterfly-dag.\nTo estimate the causal effect of `x` on `y`, we need to account for `m` because it's a counfounder.\nHowever, `m` is also a collider between `a` and `b`, so controlling for it will induce a relationship between those variables, creating a second set of confounders.\nIf we have all the variables measured well, we can avoid the bias from adjusting for `m` by adjusting for either `a` or `b` as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggdag_adjustment_set(butterfly_bias()) +\n  theme_dag() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The adjustment sets in the case of butterfly bias: we can get an unbiased effect by accounting for both `m` and the collider bias induced by adjusting for it. But what if we don't have `a` or `b`?\n](chapter-07_files/figure-html/fig-butterfly-sets-1.png){#fig-butterfly-sets width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, what should we do if we don't have those variables?\nAdjusting for `m` opens a biasing pathway that we cannot block through `a` and `b`(collider-stratification bias), but `m` is also a confounder for `x` and `y`.\nAs in the case above, it appears that confounding bias is often the worse of the two options, so we should adjust for `m` unless we have reason to believe it will cause more problems than it solves [@DingMiratrix2015].\n\n### Don't use prediction metrics for causal modeling\n\nBy and large, metrics commonly used for building prediction models are inappropriate for building causal models.\nResearchers and data scientists often make decisions about models using metrics like R^2^, AUC, accuracy, and (often inappropriately) p-values.\nHowever, a causal model's goal is not to predict as much about the outcome as possible [@hernan2021]; the goal is to estimate the relationship between the exposure and outcome accurately.\nA causal model needn't predict particularly well to be unbiased.\n\nThese metrics, however, may help identify a model's best *functional form*.\nGenerally, we'll use DAGs and our domain knowledge to build the model itself.\nHowever, we may be unsure of the mathematical relationship between a confounder and the outcome or exposure.\nFor instance, we may not know if the relationship is linear.\nMisspecifying this relationship can lead to residual confounding: we may only partially account for the confounder in question, leaving some bias in the estimate.\nTesting different functional forms using prediction-focused metrics can help improve the model's accuracy, potentially allowing for better control.\n\nAnother technique researchers sometimes use to determine confounders is to add a variable, then calculate the percent change in the coefficient between the outcome and exposure.\nFor instance, we first model `y ~ x` to estimate the relationship between `x` and `y`.\nThen, we model `y ~ x + z` and see how much the coefficient on `x` has changed.\nA common rule is to add a variable if it changes the coefficient of`x` by 10%.\n\nUnfortunately, this technique is unreliable.\nAs we've discussed, controlling for mediators, colliders, and instrumental variables all affect the estimate of the relationship between `x` and `y`, and usually, they result in bias.\nIn other words, there are many different types of variables besides confounders that can cause a change in the coefficient of the exposure.\nAs discussed above, confounding bias is often the most crucial factor, but systematically searching your variables for anything that changes the exposure coefficient can compound many types of bias.\n",
